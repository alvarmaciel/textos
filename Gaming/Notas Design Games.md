A MECHANIC IS A rule about how a game works.
==========
During play, mechanics and players interact to generate EVENTS.
==========
An event is something that happens during play.
==========
Game designers don’t design events. We design systems of mechanics that generate events
==========
To be meaningful, an event must provoke emotion.
==========
When the generated events provoke pride, hilarity, awe, or terror, the game works.
==========
Detecting and understanding subtle emotions is a designer skill.
==========
What really matters is how a game makes us feel.
==========
The emotions of play are not limited to “fun.”
==========
Your unconscious mind constantly analyzes your situation. When certain conditions are met, the unconscious triggers an emotional response.
==========
An EMOTIONAL TRIGGER is some thing or observation that causes emotion.

como disparador de emociones ha de ser la clave

==========
The bedrock principle behind all emotional triggers is change.
==========
To provoke emotion, an event must change some HUMAN VALUE.
==========
A HUMAN VALUE is anything that is important to people that can shift through multiple states.
==========
Some examples of human values are [life/death], [victory/defeat], [friend/stranger/enemy], [wealth/poverty], [low status/high status], [together/alone], [love/ambivalence/hatred], [freedom/slavery], [danger/safety], [knowledge/ignorance], [skilled/unskilled], [healthy/sick], and [follower/leader].
==========
These are life-changing events because they represent huge shifts from ignorance to knowledge,
==========
Emotions don’t just appear in response to a change. They also appear in anticipation of change.
==========
A reveal of information is emotionally equivalent to change.
==========
In some games, it can be hard to constantly generate changes in human values. These situations can be kept more interesting by not telling players everything, and instead rationing out information in a structured way to create suspense.
==========
We can’t directly perceive the logic behind our emotional triggers.
==========
psychological disconnect between emotions and their causes.
==========
because our emotions do not report their true causes.
==========
We think we feel a certain way for one reason, when the reason is completely different.
==========
tricking people into being afraid of a person when they’re actually afraid of a scary noise.
==========
Even though we don’t know why we feel as we do, we effortlessly assign logical causes to our emotions without realizing it. These assumed causes are often wrong.
==========
Emotional misattribution makes it hard to understand how games affect us.
